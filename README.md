### Hi y'all! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at SENAI CIMATEC, building state-of-the-art deep learning algorithmns to solve many problems in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Time Series and so on.
- ðŸŒ± I'm really passionate about learning. I'm always learning new tools and techniques useful in the data analysis world! I love deep learning, but Computer Vision has the key to my heart. I have worked in a few real life Computer Vision problems and the more I learn the more I fall in love for this little field in the great deep learning sea! I can also properly handle NLP and Time Series tasks, having provided effective solutions for the industry in both fields. I can assure that my simple Github repository do not reflect my true knowledge, since all the projects I have worked for are confidential and was never allowed to upload parts of them in here.
