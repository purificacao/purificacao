### Hi y'all! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at SENAI CIMATEC, building state-of-the-art deep learning algorithmns to solve many problems in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Time Series and so on.
- ðŸŒ± I'm really passionate about learning. I'm always learning new tools and techniques useful in the data analysis world! My stronger passion is Computer Vision. I have worked in a few real life Computer Vision problems and the more I learn the more I fall in love for this little field in the great deep learning world! I can also handle NLP well, as long as Time Series problems.
